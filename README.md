### Hi there 👋

# 👨‍💻 About me:
Experienced Senior Frontend Engineer with over 7+ years of experience and a proven track record in delivering projects at both startup and enterprise-level. Some milestones I am most proud of: I independently developed and launched a report generation service that generated over hundreds of thousands of pounds in revenue. I also led the migration of an enterprise AngularJS application, enhancing the performance, security, and stability.

# 🛠️ Career Journey:
Ever since starting my career as a software engineer, I took on larger projects and explored new technologies from JavaScript/TypeScript and its frameworks (Angular, React) to going fullstack with Node.js and AWS. My time as a Senior Developer taught me how to technically lead a team, manage a project effectively, and ensure consistent and clear communication with all stakeholders.

# 🚀 Early Interests:
Ever since I was little, I would often find myself at the computer, tinkering with configurations and fixing issues. This love for troubleshooting led me to obtain a degree in Computer Science and pursue a Master's Degree to refine my skills.

# 📊 Current Project:
My current project involves creating a user-friendly web platform for advertising agencies that streamlines the process of building quotes using the CPQ (Configure, Price, Quote) strategy. I work with Angular and TypeScript on a daily basis, as well as bits and pieces of Node.js. In the last years, I also expanded my knowledge of React.js and the Cloud, including the AWS ecosystem.

# 🌐 Leisure Activities:
When I'm not working I spend time with my family trying to keep my kids as busy as possible. Outside of family life, I love to stay active by getting outdoors for a walk, run, or hike, and I also enjoy cycling and have a keen interest in investing.
